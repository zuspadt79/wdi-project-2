####The build
* HTML5, CSS3, BootStrap, JS, jQuery, ES6, JWT
* Google Maps API, Google Directions, Geolocation and Open Charge Map API 
* Google Fonts - RaleWay
* SnazzyMaps



#### Challenges

Google Directions took a long time to impliment. As did Geo-location.  I feel I should be further along with my knowledge of JS than I am at this point, and required too much help to complete the project.
I also feel that my app lacks the functionality it needs, but given a few more days (possibly a week) I think I could impliment charger selection and way points. Possibly information on each charger via a modal pop-up when a map marker is clicked.
